<h3>What is our aim?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">We provide estimates of the effective reproductive number, R<sub>e</sub>, based on longitudinal measurements of influenza RNA in wastewater. We also provide estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases in each catchment for comparison.
<p/>
<h3>Interpreting R<sub>e</sub></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">The effective reproductive number, R<sub>e</sub>, quantifies the expected number of people an infected individual will infect over time. An R<sub>e</sub> above 1 indicates a growing epidemic, while an R<sub>e</sub> below 1 indicates a shrinking epidemic. The confidence bounds around R<sub>e</sub> (shaded areas in the plots) aim to provide an estimate for uncertainty about the precise value of R<sub>e</sub>. Wide confidence bounds that include 1 mean we cannot be very certain based on the current data whether the epidemic is growing or shrinking.
<p/>
<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">Since infected individuals excrete influenza RNA into the sewer system (via saliva, feces, and/or sputum), wastewater samples reflect the number of people in a particular catchment area that are infected with influenza. These longitudinal measurements of influenza RNA in wastewater are then used to estimate R<sub>e</sub>. Our detailed approach for influenza is documented in <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.23.23284894v1">this preprint</a>. In particular, we use the R package <a href="https://covid-19-re.github.io/estimateR/">EstimateR</a> to estimate R<sub>e</sub> from the wastewater and case data. The method has also previously been applied to SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, those results are available <a href="https://ibz-shiny.ethz.ch/wastewaterRe/">here</a>.
<p/>
<h3>What are limitations?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">Monitoring wastewater as an indicator of the epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory viruses is an emerging and rapidly evolving field. Wastewater is a complex matrix: heterogeneity in the sample, variation in nucleic acid recovery, and impacts of inhibition on detection can all introduce variation in the wastewater measurements and the estimated effective reproduction number. Moreover, the polymerase chain reaction-based methods used to generate data may not capture all currently circulating lineages of viruses. Thus, the results presented here are to the best of our current knowledge, but may change as new data, particularly on quality control, emerge. For strengths and limitations of our current method to estimate R<sub>e</sub> from wastewater, please refer to <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10050">this paper</a>.

Please note that laboratory-confirmed case numbers for the most recent 2-3 weeks are typically not yet complete due to reporting delays. As a result, the most recent R<sub>e</sub> estimates based on confirmed cases may be slightly downward biased. In contrast, the R<sub>e</sub> estimates based on wastewater are not biased by reporting delays.

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px"> This project uses data on influenza virus loads in wastewater that are generated by EAWAG and the State Laboratory of the canton of Basel-Stadt. It also compares the confirmed influenza cases reported to the mandatory notification system of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Data are kindly provided on a weekly basis by the FOPH. Sarah Nadeau developed the dashboard for influenza based on code originally written by Taru Singhal and Jana Huisman. Chaoran Chen and Adrian Lison helped set up and maintain the dashboard. Funding for this project comes from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

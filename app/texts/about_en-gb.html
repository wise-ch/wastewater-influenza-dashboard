<h3>What is our aim?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">We provide estimates of the effective reproductive number, R<sub>e</sub>, based on longitudinal measurements of influenza RNA in wastewater. We also provide estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases in each catchment for comparison.
<p/>
<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">The effective reproductive number, R<sub>e</sub>, quantifies the expected number of people an infected individual will infect over time. Since infected individuals excrete influenza RNA into the sewer system (via saliva, feces, and/or sputum), wastewater samples reflect the number of people in a particular catchment area that are infected with influenza. These longitudinal measurements of influenza RNA in wastewater are then used to estimate R<sub>e</sub>. We use the R package <a href="https://covid-19-re.github.io/estimateR/">EstimateR</a> to estimate R<sub>e</sub> from the wastewater and case data. This method has previously been applied to SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, those results are available <a href="https://ibz-shiny.ethz.ch/wastewaterRe/">here</a>.

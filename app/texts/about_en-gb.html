<h3>What is our aim?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">We provide estimates of the effective reproductive number, R<sub>e</sub>, based on longitudinal measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. These estimates provide an independent account of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, complementing existing R<sub>e</sub> estimates based on clinical data such as confirmed cases, hospitalisations and/or deaths.
<br>The purpose of this dashboard is to visualise the Re estimates from wastewater for the wastewater treatment plants that are part of the AbwasSARS-CoV-2 project in Switzerland. These estimates are shown together with existing R<sub>e</sub> estimates from clinical data sources (for the corresponding cantons).
<p/>
<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">The effective reproductive number, R<sub>e</sub>, quantifies the expected number of people an infected individual will infect over time. Since infected individuals excrete substantial amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into the sewer system (via saliva, feces, and/or sputum), wastewater samples reflect the number of people in a particular catchment area that are infected with COVID-19. These longitudinal measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater are then used to estimate R<sub>e</sub>.
<br>As described in <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.21255961v1">Huisman et al.</a>, we use a pipeline that was previously developed to estimate Re from clinical data sources (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20239368v1.article-info">Huisman, Scire et al.</a>) and adapted it for use with wastewater measurements. The main difference between both methods is how the underlying time series of infection events is inferred from the input observations: clinical cases follow a delay distribution from infection to case confirmation, whereas wastewater measurements follow a shedding load distribution from infection to viral shedding.
<br>Currently, these methods are applied to measurements of the <b>SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene</b>.

<h3>Who is involved?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;padding:15px;border-radius:10px">This dashboard is developed by Taru Singhal, supervised by Jana Huisman and Tanja Stadler (<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo">Computational Evolution group</a>, ETH Zurich).
<br>The underlying wastewater measurements are collected by teams at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) and EPFL, supervised by Tim Julian, Christoph Ort, and Tamar Kohn.
<br>Funding for this project stems from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.
